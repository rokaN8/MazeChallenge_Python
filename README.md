# MazeChallenge_Python
## Info
WIP solution for Amazon Maze Challenge from (http://c.adccpt.com/#/challenges/2c9f9f0c545bb87e015494c00b11003c) converted to Python.

Currently a bruteforce solution working up till 5x5 grid size due to CPU time constraints.

Idea for this solution is to use opencv and a floodfill to find if a path exists from the top of the maze till the bottom.
